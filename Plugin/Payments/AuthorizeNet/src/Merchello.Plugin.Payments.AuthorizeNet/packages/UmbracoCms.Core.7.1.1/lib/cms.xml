             Actions and Actionhandlers are a key concept to umbraco and a developer whom wish to apply
             businessrules whenever data is changed within umbraco, by implementing the IActionHandler
             interface it's possible to invoke methods (foreign to umbraco) - this can be used whenever
             there is a specific rule which needs to be applied to content.
            
             The Action class itself has responsibility for registering actions and actionhandlers,
             and contains methods which will be invoked whenever a change is made to ex. a document, media or member
             
             An action/actionhandler will automatically be registered, using reflection 
             which is enabling thirdparty developers to extend the core functionality of
             umbraco without changing the codebase.

            our stored list of proeprtyTypeIds. We then have a cached list of Property objects which will get returned

            This is here for performance reasons only. If the _contentTypeIcon is manually set
            then a database call is not made to initialize the ContentType.
            
            The data layer has slightly changed in 4.1 so that for Document and Media, the ContentType
            is automatically initialized with one SQL call when creating the documents/medias so using this
            method or the ContentType.IconUrl property when accessing the icon from Media or Document 
            won't affect performance.

            This is needed due to a design flaw where the Umbraco membership provider is located 
            in a separate project referencing this project, which means we can't call special methods
            directly on the UmbracoMemberShipMember class.
            This is a helper implementation only to be able to use the encryption functionality 
            of the membership provides (which are protected).
            
            ... which means this class should have been marked internal with a Friend reference to the other assembly right??

            This checks what the default rendering engine is set in config but then also ensures that there isn't already 
            a template that exists in the opposite rendering engine's template folder, then returns the appropriate 
            rendering engine to use.

            <returns></returns>
            <remarks>
            The reason this is required is because for example, if you have a master page file already existing under ~/masterpages/Blah.aspx
            and then you go to create a template in the tree called Blah and the default rendering engine is MVC, it will create a Blah.cshtml 
            empty template in ~/Views. This means every page that is using Blah will go to MVC and render an empty page. 
            This is mostly related to installing packages since packages install file templates to the file system and then create the 
            templates in business logic. Without this, it could cause the wrong rendering engine to be used for a package.

            This Class implements the Difference Algorithm published in
            "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" by Eugene Myers
            Algorithmica Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, p 251.  
            
            There are many C, Java, Lisp implementations public available but they all seem to come
            from the same source (diffutils) that is under the (unfree) GNU public License
            and cannot be reused as a sourcecode for a commercial application.
            There are very old C implementations that use other (worse) algorithms.
            Microsoft also published sourcecode of a diff-tool (windiff) that uses some tree data.
            Also, a direct transfer from a C source to C# is not easy because there is a lot of pointer
            arithmetic in the typical C solutions and i need a managed solution.
            These are the reasons why I implemented the original published algorithm from the scratch and
            make it avaliable without the GNU license limitations.
            I do not need a high performance diff tool because it is used only sometimes.
            I will do some performace tweaking when needed.
            
            The algorithm itself is comparing 2 arrays of numbers so when comparing 2 text documents
            each line is converted into a (hash) number. See DiffText(). 
            
            Some chages to the original algorithm:
            The original algorithm was described using a recursive approach and comparing zero indexed arrays.
            Extracting sub-arrays and rejoining them is very performance and memory intensive so the same
            (readonly) data arrays are passed arround together with their lower and upper bounds.
            This circumstance makes the LCS and SMS functions more complicate.
            I added some code to the LCS function to get a fast response on sub-arrays that are identical,
            completely deleted or inserted.
            
            The result from a comparisation is stored in 2 arrays that flag for modified (deleted or inserted)
            lines in the 2 data arrays. These bits are then analysed to produce a array of Item objects.
            
            Further possible optimizations:
            (first rule: don't do it; second: don't do it yet)
            The arrays DataA and DataB are passed as parameters, but are never changed after the creation
            so they can be members of the class to avoid the paramter overhead.
            In SMS is a lot of boundary arithmetic in the for-D and for-k loops that can be done by increment
            and decrement of local variables.
            The DownVector and UpVector arrays are alywas created and destroyed each time the SMS gets called.
            It is possible to reuse tehm when transfering them to members of the class.
            See TODO: hints.

            Changes:
            2002.09.20 There was a "hang" in some situations.
            Now I undestand a little bit more of the SMS algorithm. 
            There have been overlapping boxes; that where analyzed partial differently.
            One return-point is enough.
            A assertion was added in CreateDiffs when in debug-mode, that counts the number of equal (no modified) lines in both arrays.
            They must be identical.
            
            2003.02.07 Out of bounds error in the Up/Down vector arrays in some situations.
            The two vetors are now accessed using different offsets that are adjusted using the start k-Line. 
            A test case is added. 
            
            2006.03.05 Some documentation and a direct Diff entry point.
            
            2006.03.08 Refactored the API to static methods on the Diff class to make usage simpler.
            2006.03.10 using the standard Debug class for self-test now.
                       compile with: csc /target:exe /out:diffTest.exe /d:DEBUG /d:TRACE /d:SELFTEST Diff.cs
            2007.01.06 license agreement changed to a BSD style license.
            2007.06.03 added the Optimize method.

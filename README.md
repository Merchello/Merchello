# Merchello

Merchello is a high performance, designer friendly, open source [Umbraco CMS](http://www.umbraco.com) package built for the store owner.

## What Merchello does for you

In version 1, Merchello supports a large variety of products with options that can be attached to a single warehouse, processes orders, manages taxes and shipping, and sends out email notifications to your customers. The beauty of Merchello is that while it oversees all of your products, orders, and store settings, it allows Umbraco to maintain your content. This seamless integration gives you the flexibility to build your store in any way imagineable on a robust platform capable of handling a wide variety of store sizes.

Version 2.3.0 is here! Check the new 2.3.0 features https://github.com/Merchello/Merchello/releases/tag/2.3.0 .

## Basic features

Merchello comes with the following core features, but it's also built so you can expand on it to your needs. Here's what you get right out of the box:

* Products with  options and variants
* Flat rate shipping provider (by weight or price) for a single warehouse that can be adjusted by country and region
* Cash payment provider (for cash, check, cod, pay by phone, etc)
* Both invoicing and orders, created with each purchase
* Multiple currencies
* Product Picker datatype for Umbraco that lets you connect your Merchello product with your Umbraco content.
* Extended Content on Products and Options (Similar to Nested Content) - Use existing Umbraco property editors on your products and options.
* Products & Sales Collections - Organise your products and sales efficiently

###build & build-dev
Once you have completed these steps, you need to make sure all the node dependencies are installed.

The build command for release:
grunt build

The build command for dev:
grunt build-dev

###npm install dependencies
If you run these build commands and you receive an error that a dependency is missing, you need to install it:
npm install xyz (whatever the dependency name is)

###Run Bazaar solution 
The build process above places the files in the /App_Plugins directory in the Bazaar project in the source tree. Test the client-side files you just built by opening and running the Bazaar solution.

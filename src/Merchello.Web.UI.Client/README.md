# Merchello Angular Tests

This project is designed to help test Merchello specific javascript components without the need
for a full Umbraco install.

## Setup

###Install node.js
We need node to run tests and automated less compiling and other automated tasks. go to http://nodejs.org. Node.js is a powerfull javascript engine, which allows us to run all our tests and tasks written in javascript locally.

*note:* On windows you might need to restart explorer.exe to register node.


###Install dependencies
Next we need to install all the required packages. This is done with the package tool, included with node.js, go to the /src/Merchello.Web.Ui.Client directory in cmd.exe or osx terminal and run the command:

	npm install

this will fetch all needed packages to your local machine.

## Testing

### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `node scripts/web-server.js` from the /src/Merchello.Web.Ui.Client directory in cmd.exe or osx terminal

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma` for Mac or `npm install -g karma` for Windows) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test`)  from the /src/Merchello.Web.Ui.Client directory in cmd.exe or osx terminal
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
  * Browse to the '/app' directory
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test`
